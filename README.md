# sudoku-demo

A simple project to solve sudoku puzzles. Write the puzzle numbers into input.txt in resources, run main and see your result in output.txt.

I created this project as an exercise for my Java certification exam. I also enjoy solving sudoku, and since I found it can be solved by graph coloring, I wanted to try implementing it.

The method is somewhat limited when it comes to more difficult puzzles, so I want to try implementing other methods in the future.
